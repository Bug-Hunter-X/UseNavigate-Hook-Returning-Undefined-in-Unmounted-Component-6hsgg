In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating using the `useNavigate` hook within a component that's not rendered yet. This results in the `useNavigate` hook returning `undefined`, causing errors when attempting to navigate. This often occurs with components that render conditionally, such as during initial page load or after fetching data.

```javascript
// Buggy Component
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  useEffect(() => {
    // This will cause an error if the component isn't mounted yet
    navigate('/someRoute');
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>My Component</div>
  );
}
```
